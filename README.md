# core #

This is an experimental prototype package of what might constitute the core of Dojo 2.  It is here in order to support
other packages that I am working on.  Almost all of the work here is derived directly from [Dojo 1.X][dojo],
[ComposeJS][compose] and [put-selector][].

It also uses a next-generation browser technology [polyfill][promises] of DOM Promises.
